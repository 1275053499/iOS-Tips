#iOS Tech Set


## What it is

Sharing experience and ideas in iOS development always makes us fulfilled, and that is the reason we start this repo -- to share, to learn, and to make progress step by step.

This repo focuses on elaborating any practical iOS dev tips within 300 words (code and demo are not inclued); thus everyone could grab knowledge within a uber or subway ride.

On the other hand, this is not the shortcut to iOS dev. We encourage to reference more to understand the related knowledge deeply. Also, 

## About the repo

It first starts with my daily update on Weibo (Chinese Twitter). Afterwards, increasing number of people start to read these knowledge. Under such case, Github repo would be the best place to archive all these iOS dev tips: easy to reference and convenient to read. However, these points are not organized under a same topic since we daily collect them randomly on the internet.

Please note some tips' source is unclear. For authoers, please reach out to us if you do not agree to put your posts here. 

Also, some ideas here may be outdated due to the fast speed of Apple's API updates.

Thanks to [Lefe_x](https://weibo.com/u/5953150140)'s reminder, I came to realize that the repo should be maintained by developers interested in iOS, instead of any single person. To make it the next big thing in iOS community, everyone is welcome to share experience and contribute here. 

Please reach out to [南峰子_老驴](http://weibo.com/touristdiary) if interested. And I believe that, we could really make a difference with your assistance.
